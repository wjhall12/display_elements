  <!-- move the paragraphs around and images to see how they are displayed on a page. Remember, block is the default display element for paragraphs. Which means the paragraph goes all the way to the end of the line, unless you add a width element. Inline elements allow you to put items on the same line but can't change the width. Inline-block will allow you to put items on the same line and change the width. -->
